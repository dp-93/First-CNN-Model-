# First-CNN-Model-
I used CIFAR-10 dataset to train this CNN model

## Project 6: CNN for Image Classification and Deployment

This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end computer vision workflow. I built, trained, and optimized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify 10 categories of real-world images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

The final step was deploying the model as a live, interactive web application using Gradio.

* **Model Used:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* **Final Accuracy on Test Set:** 73.14%
* **Tools:** TensorFlow, Keras, Python, Gradio

### Key Skills Demonstrated:
* **CNN Architecture:** Designed and built a multi-layer CNN from scratch.
* **Model Optimization:** Iteratively improved model performance by deepening the architecture and adding Dropout for regularization.
* **Deployment:** Packaged the trained model into an interactive web application with Gradio, allowing for inference on external user-uploaded images.

### Interactive Demo
Here is a demonstration of the final web application in action:
